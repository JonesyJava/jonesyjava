### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael Jones and I'm currently a student at Boise Codeworks. I moved to Boise 5 years ago from Indiana, where I was born and raised. I'm a graduate from Purdue University, with a Bachelor's Degree in Forensic Anthropology. Fun Fact! I also have a twin brother who codes aswell here in Boise! 

Thank you for checking out my page and feel free to reach out if you like what you see!
