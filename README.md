### Hi there Fellow Devs and Humans! 👋

💬 I'm Michael Jones and I'm currently a student at Boise Codeworks becoming a Fullstack Developer. I'm a graduate from Purdue University, with a Bachelor's Degree in Forensic Anthropology. I have a passion for Coding, Human Interaction, and Sciences. Understanding how humans utilize and interact with technology is an obsession I've had since being gifted my first computer in 1995.

Fun Fact! I also have a twin brother who codes aswell here in Boise!
