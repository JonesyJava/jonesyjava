### Hello Fellow Devs! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ My name is Michael Jones and I'm currently the Brand and Business Development Manager at Boise Codeworks. I'm a graduate from both Boise Codeworks & Purdue University. I graduated from Purdue with a Bachelor's Degree in Forensic Anthropology and recieved my fullstack developers certification of completion from Boise Codeworks. I have a passion for Coding, Human Interaction, and Sciences. Understanding how humans utilize and interact with technology is an obsession I've had since being gifted my first computer in 1995.
